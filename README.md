# Revamped [Stoat Desktop App](https://github.com/stoatchat/for-desktop) for QStoat

QStoat is stoat for stoat.qinbeans.net. Specific to the friend group of the author, but can be used by anyone. It is a desktop application built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) with the modified frontend of the original [Stoat Web](https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web).

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

**Modified GIF backend to use Klipy**

This is not meant for other people to use, but if you want to use it, you will likely need to modify many pieces to get it to work with your own stoat instance.
